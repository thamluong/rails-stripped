1.After integration with user authentication gem like Devise, replace
# the hard-coded dummy value 'current_user.email' with the current user email in SubscriptionsController     
  
2. Make the Stripe related code robust. Write tests.

begin
  # Use Stripe's bindings...
rescue Stripe::CardError => e
  # Since it's a decline, Stripe::CardError will be caught
	THIS IS DONE
rescue Stripe::InvalidRequestError => e
  # Invalid parameters were supplied to Stripe's API
rescue Stripe::AuthenticationError => e
  # Authentication with Stripe's API failed
  # (maybe you changed API keys recently)
rescue Stripe::APIConnectionError => e
  # Network communication with Stripe failed
rescue Stripe::StripeError => e
  # Display a very generic error to the user, and maybe send
  # yourself an email
rescue => e
  # Something else happened, completely unrelated to Stripe
end

3. Purchase one product using Stripe. Allow guest checkout. Create account later as an option.
