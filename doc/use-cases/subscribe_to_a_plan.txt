Assumptions
-----------

1. It is a good practice to provide user few weeks of free trial after signup to show how the SaaS application is useful. After the free trial ends, the user will be prompted for the credit card details to complete the subscription. Since the user is already logged in, we already know their email address. So, we don't need a form field for the email.

2. Plans are created once. You can create it manually using the Stripe dashboard. You can also create it using the Stripe API. For details read the : Recurring Billing using Stripe API article. http://rubyplus.com/articles/941

Use Case : Subscribe to Gold Plan
----------------------------------------

Given that the Gold Plan already exists. Customer can signup for the gold plan.

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/subscriptions/new
2. Fill in 4242424242424242 for card number and any date in the future for expiration date.
3. Click 'Subscribe Me' button.

Alternate Scenarios
--------------------

1. Invalid credit card number
2. Invalid expiration month
3. Invalid expiration year
4. Submit the default form without entering any value for the form elements.
